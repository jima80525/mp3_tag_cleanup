# mp3_tag_cleanup
Cleans up mp3 tags and filenames for audiobooks to be in the Track_xx format

Use pip install -r requirements to set up the virtualenv.

Run from the top level directory of the audiobook.  Will walk entire tree,
modifying all of the mp3 files below the current directory.

WARNING: Not production quality.  This is merely a script I wrote to clean up a
single instance of a problem.  Committing it to save it in the hopes I will
expand it later.
